# This mobile application is an app that ISCAP attendees can look at to view their schedues and other information

This app will let you see a message board, and it will be updated throughout the conference with important updates

The second feature, will have a schedule, with this we used a calender to show when things were happening that day and time
With this you can also search for events going on

Our third feature is a map, sometimes people are confused that these conferences are really held in a hotel
We provided a map that showed the distance between things and a 3d view of the actual hotel
Providing streets around and things around
